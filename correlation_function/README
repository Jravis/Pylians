This folder contains several codes to compute the TPCF (two point correlation 
function).

---- random_catalogue.py ----
This code creates a random distribution of points within a box of size 1.0. 
The code saves later the results into a binary file.
When computing the terms RR and DR, it is important to use always the same
catalogue. The term RR can be computed just one, for a given bin distribution.
The term DR has to be computed everytime, and the catalogue has to be the same
as this from which the term RR is obtained.


---- correlation_function.py ----
This code computes the TPCF for halos/subhalos or CDM/NU particles from an
N-body simulation. If the simulation contains both CDM and neutrinos, then
the code cross_correlation_function.py must be used to compute the correlation
function of the total DM density field.
If the TPCF of halos is wanted, user should specify how to define the virial 
radius: m200, c200 or t200 (200xmean_density, 200xcritical_density or 
200xtop_hat).
For subhalos only mass of the subhalo can be choosen (Subfind only contains this)
If the TPCF of CDM/NU is wanted, the code will randomly select N_par from the
total N-body particles and compute the TPCF from that subset.
If the TPCF of the total DM is wanted, this code can only be used when there 
is no neutrino particles, i.e. for simulations with Mnu=0.0
With DD_action,RR_action and DR_action we specify whether the number of 
galaxy-galaxy, random-random and galaxy-random pairs are going to be counted
("compute") or just read from a file ("read"). The names of the files from which
results are read or written are given by DD_name, RR_name and DR_name.


---- cross_correlation_function.py ----
This code computes the TPCF for N-body simulations with more than 1 particle
type (for example simulations with CDM and neutrinos). The code computes the
TPCF for each component, their cross-correlation function and the TPCF for the
total DM field.
The proportions of each component, in terms of Omega_CDM and Omega_NU should
be specified. The code will randomly select Np particles of each type to compute
the autocorrelation and the cross-correlation functions.
With DD_action,RR_action and DR_action we specify whether the number of 
galaxy-galaxy, random-random and galaxy-random pairs are going to be counted
("compute") or just read from a file ("read"). The names of the files from which
results are read or written are given by DD_name, RR_name and DR_name.


---- total_correlation_function.py ----
This code is used to compute the DM correlation function from the CDM and NU
autocorrelation functions plus the CDM-NU cross-correlation function. The code
inside it also contained in the cross_correlation_function.py code, so in
principle this code should not be used unless we only have the TPCF for the 
CDM, NU and CDM-NU and want to compute the TPCF of the DM.


---- RR files ----
The RR files contains the number of RR pairs counted from the random catalogue.
The way this file is written can be found on the correlation_function_library.py
The name of the files is RR_Rmin_Rmax_bins_Np.dat, where Rmin and Rmax (in Mpc/h)
are the minimum and maximum distances to fill the number of bins. Np is the 
number of particles contained in the random catalogue.
For computing the TPCF it is good to use these files and avoid computing the
number of random pairs. It is important that the bins used are equal to those
of the RR files, and that the random catalogue used (for computing the DR term) is the same that the one used for computing the RR files.
If the RR files are not present, the code RR_file.py can be used to get them.The RR file obtained can be used in the future for measuring the TPCF of CDM or neutrinos.


---- results ----
This folder contains the TPCF files computed. There can be several folders
inside named: Rmin_Rmax_bins for distinguishing the different bins used.
