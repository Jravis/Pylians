# Fcodes

The Fcodes are a set of python/cython/c libraries and scripts that can be used to analyze the output of numerical simulations (both N-body and hydro). Among their functionalities there are:

- Compute density field
- Compute power spectra
- Compute correlation functions
- Identify voids
- Populate halos with galaxies using an HOD
- Apply HI+H2 corrections to the output of hydrodynamic simulations
- Make 21cm maps

## Requisites

- numpy
- scipy
- pyfftw
- cython
 
We recommend installing these packages with [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/?lang=en-us)
